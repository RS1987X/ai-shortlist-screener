# S (Service) dimension - Rating confidence parameters
# Ratings with fewer reviews are discounted to reflect statistical uncertainty
# Formula: confidence = min(1.0, rating_count / RATING_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD)
RATING_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 25  # Full confidence at 25+ reviews
# Rationale: 
# - 25 reviews provides reasonable statistical confidence (Â±20% margin at 95% CI)
# - Balances need for reliability vs penalizing newer products too harshly
# - Based on empirical analysis showing avg review counts: 4-60 across retailers

# JS-rendered ratings receive slightly reduced weight due to accessibility concerns
